# Usage

Use as following:
  - Compile the sources (easiest way is to use a IDE such as visual studio or Dev-C++)
  - In the build folder where your executable is stored create the `science.txt` with your data in it
  - Use http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial to study C++ topics
  - Ask questions!
